This project walks through a full end-to-end process of preparing data for a house price prediction task. It begins with data cleaning, followed by type encoding and imputation of missing values. It then creates new meaningful features, transforms and scales the data, trains a regression model, evaluates its performance, and generates a ready-to-submit prediction file.

By following this structured process, the notebook demonstrates how thoughtful feature engineering and careful preprocessing can significantly improve the accuracy of a predictive model.
